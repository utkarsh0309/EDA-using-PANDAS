This exploratory data analysis (EDA) successfully retrieved and visualized various economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API.

# Here are the key findings:

S&P 500: The S&P 500 data was successfully plotted, providing a visual representation of its historical performance.
Unemployment Rate: Monthly unemployment rate data for various states was retrieved and visualized.
State-level comparison: Unemployment rates for different states in May 2020 were compared using a bar chart.
Unemployment vs. Participation Rate: Unemployment and participation rate data for various states were plotted together, allowing for a comparison of these two key economic indicators over time.


# This EDA provides a starting point for further analysis and exploration. Further investigation could involve:

Analyzing the relationship between unemployment and participation rates across different states.
Exploring the impact of economic events on unemployment and participation rates.
Comparing unemployment and participation rates to other economic indicators such as GDP or inflation.


# By continuing this analysis, we can gain deeper insights into the economic landscape of the United States and develop a better understanding of the factors influencing unemployment and labor force participation.
